## FizzBuzz

### Lessons Learned
- Type `make` to initiate the makefile! No need to specify the filename if it's already specified in the makefile ...

- Passing strings (read: character arrays) via functions is more complicated than in Python.

- Every C program needs a `main()` function, but beware multiple files that contain a `main()`.

- There's no excuse for not doing unit tests, especially with lightweight testing frameworks such as minunit.

- No need for a complicated IDE when starting out. Do all the things manually!
